The goal was to ascertain the most efficient number of buses needed for transportation from point A to point B throughout the day, encompassing peak hours. Created an Origin-Destination Matrix for peak hours, conducted a Monte Carlo Simulation to determine the necessary number of buses, computed passenger distribution in an ideal scenario, and conducted a Cost Analysis incorporating fuel and salary expenses. Implemented a queuing system to identify the optimal number of buses required while comparing with the available buses
